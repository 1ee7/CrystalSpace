-----------------------------------------
-Added new world creating & loading system, now ID based instead of list based
-Added lang.yml to allow translating messages to your own language

-Added permission node to bypass all suit & helmet checks no matter what config says
-Added a black hole block (Spout), will generate randomly and suck entities into it and kill them
