### An unofficial effort to revive the functionality of a useful plugin

Welcome to the [CrystalCraftMC](http://crystalcraftmc.com) fork of bSpace. We have decided to make this one of our long-term projects for our server to not only help us learn, but also to benefit our own server and help us recreate one of the most amazing gametypes to be known in the world of Minecraft servers.

As more information is made available, this README file will be updated to include more information. Below are important URLs or general information about the project.

## Information
Most work on this fork is made by [jflory7](https://github.com/jflory7) and assisted by one of the original core developers of bSpace, [iffa](https://github.com/iffa). Progress is slow, but help is always welcome and appreciated in the form of bug reports and pull requests.

This project formerly had a [build server](http://ci.crystalcraftmc.com/job/CrystalSpace/), but due to cost issues, the CI Server is no longer available. We hope to be able to offer this again someday in the future. (Support for this would be awesome!!)

You can find the original bSpace plugin on [BukkitDev](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/bananaspace/), but note that we are not associated with that project page.

## Building
This project can be built with Maven. To build the project, open a command line and enter the directory of this repository.

`mvn clean package`

Running this command will generate the latest build of the plugin for you in the folder.
