# CrystalSpace v3.0-DEVEL [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CrystalCraftMC/CrystalSpace.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/CrystalCraftMC/CrystalSpace)
### An unofficial effort by the [CrystalCraftMC Development Team](http://crystalcraftmc.com) to revive the functionality of a useful plugin

Welcome to the [CrystalCraftMC](http://crystalcraftmc.com) fork of bSpace. We have decided to make this one of our
long-term projects for the team to not only help us learn, but also to benefit our own server and help us recreate one
of the most amazing gametypes to be known in the world of Minecraft.

As more information is made available, this README file will be updated to include more information. Below are important
URLs or general information about the project.
